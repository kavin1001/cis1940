{- Count the number of leaves in the tree. For example,
   [numLeaves tree] should be [3]. -}

{- Check whether a number is in the tree. For example,
   [find 1 tree] and [find 2 tree] should be [True], while
   [find 3 tree] should be [False]. -}

{- Add three to every node value in the tree. For example,
   [add3 tree] should be [Node Leaf 4 (Node Leaf 5 Leaf)]. -}
